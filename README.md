# Interdimensional Map Markers

A server-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that makes maps show your location even when in other dimensions.

Map markers added by this mod change color depending on the dimension of the player. They also account for dimension coordinates scales, so looking at an Overworld map in the Nether will show the map marker at the corresponding location in the Overworld (about where a Nether portal would lead).
